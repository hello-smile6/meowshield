meowshield shields against bad guys!!11!!1111!!!1!!1 (on scratch)

## using it
Thanks for being an epic person and helping defend against bad hackers!

### global instructions
Copy the content of `.env.example` into a new file `.env` and replace `kaj` on the first line with your username and `kajdahecker` on the next line with your password (this is for logging in, you can use a different spare account for this - it doesn't need to have scratcher status)



### python 3
Recommended version is 3.7+ (no python2 support sorry)

You will need to have:

- `python-dotenv` for loading your scratch credentials (`pip install python-dotenv`)
- `scratchclient` for logging in and using cloud with scratch (`pip install scratchclient`)

Now run `meowshield.py` and the script should start
